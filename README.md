# Hospital-Emergency-Room

Recently learned under the guidance of Satish Dhawal Sir

I recently developed this interactive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard using Microsoft Excel, guided by Satish Dhawal Sir. This project helped me understand how to transform raw data into meaningful visuals and insights using Excel features like charts, slicers, conditional formatting, and formulas.

Key Highlights of the Dashboard:

Patient Admission Status: Displays how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted, providing a quick snapshot of hospital intake.

Patient Age Distribution: Categorizes patients by age group, helping analyze which age ranges visit the ER most.

Timeliness: Shows the percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes, indicating the hospitalâ€™s service efficiency.

Gender Analysis: Visualizes the number of patients by gender (male vs. female).

Department Referrals: Highlights which departments patients are most commonly referred to (e.g., General Practice, Cardiology).

This dashboard showcases the power of Excel for data visualization, and has enhanced my skills in creating dynamic, insight-driven reports using only Excel tools.
